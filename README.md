# One-Page-Digital-Newspaper

## Inspiration
It would be so helpful for everyone if they can access trending news, weather as well as positive quotes, jokes that make them laugh and also random motivation posters from same web page. There would be no need to switch apps which will save time. And we know times are difficult due to Covid19 therefore some jokes, quotes and motivation is added to cheer users.
## What it does
It displays weather, news, quotes, jokes all in one webpage.
## How I built it
I built it using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and some API's.
## Challenges I ran into
I built this in 4 hours so it was a little stressful. One technical issue is that some websites/ compilers are not able to fetch location due to which on some browsers weather could not be checked 
## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
I am happy and proud that I could do this all in only 4 hours
## What I learned
I learned to use API's and how to create animation using JavaScript.
## What's next for Digital Morning Newspaper
Using News APIs, trending (#) hashtag APIs,adding some gifs, making it more colorful :)
